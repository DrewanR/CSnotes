## CSS Event Pseudo-Classes

CSS can detect a few basic mouse events. `:hover` and `:active` also work on other non-link elements.
```css
a:link { color: blue; }      Not yet visited
a:visited { color: purple; } Already visited
a:hover {color: green; }     Mouse goes over element
a:action {color: red; }      Element is being clicked
```
