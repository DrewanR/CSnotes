## Links
The anchor element (`<a> â€¦ </a>`) provides hypertext links between
-  different documents (using a URL)
-  different parts of the same document (using id attribute)
```html
<p> Wales' biggest university is
<a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a>.
</p>
```
### Absolute vs Relative Addressing
#### Absolute address:
`href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/index.html"`
*(suitable for links to external sites)*
#### Relative address:
`href="index.html" or href="../index.html"`
*(suitable for links to pages on the same site)*

You can, of course, use images for the links
