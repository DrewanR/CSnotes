# CSnotes
Github backup of my computer science notes.
The notes here wil not be up to date, if you wish for a more up to date version let me know.
Please dont rely on these, as I made these for myself and am only sharing them if people wanted to compare

## Viewing these notes
The notes here are created in a program called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a free [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) editor (this greately undersells it). You can view the files in near enough anything, many free markdown editors exist, though obisidian has different link syntax to most. I would just use obsidian though as it is free.

As with most obisidian users I use a lot of plugins, this repo does include the files for them and if you use the open folder button in the initial menu it should prompt you if you trust me. If not you still may be able to go into the settings for the vault and enable community puglins three and that may still work without you having to find them all.
