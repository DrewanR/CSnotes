## Sample space
of an experiment or random process is the set of all possible outcomes:

| Experiment | Sample Space |
| ---------- | ------------ |
|            |              |

## Event
An event is a subset of a sample set

Definition (probability)
Given an experiment with a sample space 𝑆 of equally likely outcomes and an event 𝐸, the probability of 𝐸 occurring is:
$$P(E)=\frac{|E|}{|S|}$$
Probability is always between 0 and 1.
## Sum rule
$$P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)$$
Follows the inclusion-exclusion principle in sets.
$$P(A∪B)=\frac{|A∪B|}{|S|}=\frac{|A|+|B|-|A∩B|}{|S|}=P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)$$
`Note:` A and B are disjoint, mutually exclusive: 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 = ∅
then it becomes $𝑃(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵)= 𝑃(𝐴) + 𝑃(𝐵)$

## Probability of the Complement
Given an event 𝐸
$$P(¬E)=1-P(E)$$
## Conditional probability
Given events 𝐴 and 𝐵, define the conditional probability 𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) (or the probability of 𝐴 given 𝐵) by:
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A∩B)}{P(B)}$$
## Product Rule
$$P(A∩B)=P(A|B)P(B)$$
Note, if 𝐴 and 𝐵 are **independent** (i.e. the occurrence of 𝐴 is not affected by the (non)occurrence of 𝐵, or 𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴)), then
$$P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B)$$
