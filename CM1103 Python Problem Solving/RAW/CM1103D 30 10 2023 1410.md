# Discrete Mathematics
> Discrete mathematics describes processes that consist of a series of individual steps.

This contrasts continuous mathematics, which doesn't have individual separate steps
## Why is it important for CS
Computers use discrete structures to represent and manipulate data.
Computer science is about problem solving, of which mathematics is the heart of.
Helps with abstract thinking.

# Introduction to Logic
Logic concerns principles is correct reasoning.
[[Logic_handout.pdf]]
# Propositional Logic
*A **proposition** is a sentence declaring a fact that is either **True** or **False***
#### Examples
Stuart Allen is the module leader of CM1103. P
Cardiff is the capital of France. P
8 + 2 = 10 P
8 + 2 = 15 P
Is it Tuesday? NP
Read this. NP
n < 5 NP
If n is 4, then n < 5 P
# Combining propositions
Compound propositions are formed from other propositions using logical operators.

## Negation `¬`
Let 𝑝 be a proposition. The negation of 𝑝, denoted ¬𝑝, is the statement “It is not the case that 𝑝”.
## Conjunction `Ʌ` and Disjunction `V`
**Conjunction:** *and*
**Disjunction:** *or*

Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be propositions. The conjunction of 𝑝 and 𝑞, denoted 𝑝 Ʌ 𝑞, is the proposition “𝑝 and 𝑞”. It is true if both 𝑝 and 𝑞 are true, and false otherwise.
Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be propositions. The disjunction of 𝑝 and 𝑞, denoted 𝑝 V 𝑞, is the proposition “𝑝 or 𝑞”. It is true if either 𝑝 or 𝑞 (or both) are true, and false otherwise.

```
p = False, q = True
p Ʌ q = False
p V q = True
```

Truth tables allow us to add more operands
Must include all the possible combinations

| p   | q   | r   | p Ʌ q | ¬r  | (pɅq)V¬r    |
| --- | --- | --- |:-----:|:---:|:---:|
| 0   | 0   | 0   |   0   |  1  | 1    |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |   0   |  0  | 0    |

## Logic in python
```Python
  ¬ y =   not y 
x Ʌ y = x and y
x V y = x or  y
x ⨁ y = x ^  y # More of a hack
```
#ToDo Transfer to [[Logic]]
## Short Circuit Evaluation
*Present in [[Python]], amongst lots of other languages*
When a Boolean operation is evaluated, the second argument is only executed or evaluated if the first ones does not suffice to determine the outcome.

**AND** *If the first argument is false, it returns false without executing the other argument*
**OR** *If the first argument is true, it wont evaluate the second argument*

Because of this, it makes sense to put the simplest arguments first and more complex ones afterwards.

## Exclusive Or / XOR `⨁`
Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be propositions. The exclusive or of 𝑝 and 𝑞, denoted 𝑝 ⨁ 𝑞, is the proposition that is true if exactly one of 𝑝 and 𝑞 are true, and false otherwise.

`NOTE:` in English, or can mean inclusive or exclusive or.
## Implication `⇒`
Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be propositions. The implication or conditional statement 𝑝 ⇒ 𝑞, is the proposition “if 𝑝 then 𝑞”. We call 𝑝 the hypothesis, 𝑞 the conclusion. It is false if 𝑝 is true and 𝑞 is false, and true otherwise. It has the truth table:

| p     | q     | p ⇒ q |
| ----- | ----- | :---: |
| 0     | 0     | 1     |
| 0     | 1     | 1     |
| **1** | **0** | **0** |
| 1     | 1     | 1     |

Think of it as a promise, where it is false is if the promise is not upheld. Say, `p` doing work, and `q` is getting money. If you do work you must get paid, however, you might still get money without doing work, but you can also get no money. 

| Example                                      |       |      |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| If 4 × 4 = 16, then −1 × −1 = 1.             | 1 ⇒ 1 | True |
| If 2 + 2 = 4, then all dogs are black.       | 1 ⇒ 0 | False |
| If 2 + 2 = 5, then all dogs are black.       | 0 ⇒ 0 | True |
| If it snows today, then 2 is a prime number. | 0 ⇒ 1 | True |

### Contrapositive
The *contrapositive* of the implication `𝑝 ⇒ 𝑞` is `¬𝑞 ⇒ ¬𝑝.`
e.g.
*you wont get money if you haven't work*
Has the same truth table, which means they are **logically equivalent**
### Converse
The *converse* of the implication 𝑝 ⇒ 𝑞 is 𝑞 ⇒ 𝑝.
Not **logically equivalent**
## Bi-condition `<=>`[^1]
Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be propositions. The bi-conditional of 𝑝 and 𝑞 is the proposition “𝑝 if, and only if, 𝑞” and is denoted 𝑝֞  𝑞. It is true if both 𝑝 and 𝑞 have the same truth values and is false if 𝑝 and 𝑞 have opposite truth values.
*Equivalent of `¬(p⨁q)`*

# Tautology
#Definition A *tautology* is a compound proposition that is always true.
# Contradiction
#Definition A *contradiction* is a compound proposition that is always false.
# Logical Equivalence `≡`
**NOT A LOGICAL OPERATOR**
Compound propositions 𝑝 and 𝑞 are logically equivalent if, and only if, 𝑝 and 𝑞 have the same truth table. The logical equivalence of 𝑝 and 𝑞 is denoted by 𝑝 ≡ 𝑞.
*Can be proved using truth tables*
## De Morgan's laws
 ¬(𝑝 V 𝑞) ≡ ¬𝑝 Ʌ ¬𝑞
 ¬(𝑝 Ʌ 𝑞) ≡ ¬𝑝 V ¬𝑞
