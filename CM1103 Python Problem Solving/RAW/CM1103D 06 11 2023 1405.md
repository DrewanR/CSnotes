# Sets
*Set theory is a formal way of dealing with collections of things*

#Definition A set is a collection of distinguishable objects (i.e. unrepeated, no duplicates), such that given a set and an object, we can decide whether the object belongs to the set or not

# Elements
#Definition We refer to the objects in a set as elements or members

The notation 𝑥 ∈ 𝑆 means “𝑥 is an element of 𝑆”.
The notation 𝑥 ∉ 𝑆 means “𝑥 is not an element of 𝑆”

Set of positive even numbers less than 10: 𝑇 = {2,4,6,8}

# Cardinality
#Definition The cardinality of a set 𝑆, denoted 𝑆 , is the number of elements it contains.

# Examples of sets
ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ⋯ } is the set of natural numbers (“counting” numbers)

ℤ = {⋯ , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ⋯ } is the set of integers.

ℚ is the set of rational numbers – those that can be defined as 𝑝 𝑞,
	where 𝑝, 𝑞 ∈ ℤ, e.g. 1 3, −17 4
	ℚ = {𝑥 ∈ ℝ ∶ 𝑥 = 𝑝 𝑞 such that 𝑝, 𝑞 ∈ ℤ}

ℝ is the set of real numbers – all decimal numbers, e.g. 3 4, 42, 0.451937 (possibly with unending digits after the decimal point, e.g. 𝜋, 0.333…, 2) 

ℂ is the set of complex numbers – e.g. sqrt(−1), but we don’t cover these in this module
# Describing sets mathematically
| {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}                | List the elements    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| {0,1,2, ..., 9}                      | Abbreviate the list  |
| {x: x is an integer and 0 <= x < 10} | Set builder notation |
| {𝑥 ∈ ℤ: 0 ≤ 𝑥 < 10                  | Describe the element in fancy mathematical way                     |
# Subsets `⊆`
𝐴 is a subset of 𝐵 (written 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵) if every element of 𝐴 is also an element of 𝐵. I.e. ∀𝑥, if 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 then 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵

A set is equal to B, when they have ***exactly*** the same elements 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 and 𝐵 ⊆ 𝐴

*A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A is a subset of A...*
## Proper Subset `⊂`
𝐴 is a proper subset of 𝐵 (written 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵) if it is a subset of 𝐵 but not equal to 𝐵, i.e. 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 and 𝐴 ≠ 𝐵, which means every element of 𝐴 is in 𝐵 but there is at least one element of 𝐵 that is not in 𝐴

N ⊆ Z but Z !⊆ N. N ⊂ Z
Z ⊆ q but Q !⊆ Z.

# Operation on sets
The universal set is the set of all possible elements, denoted by 𝕌. The exact definition of 𝕌 will depend on the context.

The empty set is the set with zero elements, and is denoted by { } or ∅.
∅ ⊆ ∅
∅ !⊂ ∅
## Union `A∪B`
The union of sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 is denoted 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵, and is defined as: 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 = {𝑥: 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 or 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵}
## Intersection `A∩B`
The intersection of sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 is denoted 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵, and is defined as: 𝐴  𝐵 = {𝑥: 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵
## Difference `A-B`
The difference of sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 is denoted 𝐴 − 𝐵, and is defined as: 𝐴 − 𝐵 = {𝑥: 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑥 ∉ 𝐵}
***Everything in A and not in B***
## Complement
The complement of a set 𝐴 is denoted 𝐴 (or 𝐴𝐶 ), and is defined as: 𝐴 = 𝕌 − 𝐴 = {𝑥: 𝑥 ∈ 𝕌 and 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴}

# Power Set
The power set of a set 𝑆, denoted 𝒫(𝑆), is the set of all subsets of 𝑆
