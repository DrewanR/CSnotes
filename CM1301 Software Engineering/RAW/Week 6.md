## Non function requirements:
speed, usability, stability, capacity

Product requirement
Organisational requirement
External requirement

External qualities:
	use by different target groups
	understandability, learnability and operability

Internal qualities:
	Maintainability etc.

More critical than functional requirements:
	Failing means that the whole system is unusable
	**non-functional requirements must be measurable**

# Quality
## Reliability - its ability not to fail.
-  Accuracy: The precision of computations and output
	-  Check in Unit Tests
	-  Check for common errors
-  Consistency
-  Error tolerance: The degree to which continuity of operation is ensured under adverse conditions
	-  Exception handling to ensure program can continue
## Efficiency – the amount of computing resources and code required by a program to perform its function.
-  Execution efficiency: Run-time efficiency of the software
-  Storage efficiency: Run-time storage requirements of the software
## Integrity - the protection of the program from unauthorised access.
-  Access audit: Ease which software and data can be checked for compliance with standards or other requirements
-  Access control: Provisions for control & protection of software & data
## Usability – Effort required to learn, operate, prepare input and interpret output of a program.
-  Communicativeness: Provision of useful inputs and outputs that can be easily assimilated.
	- Use Schneiderman’s principles & guidelines when designing interfaces
-  Operability: Ease of operation of the software
	- Good use of widgets to minimise user input
	- Anticipate main user errors
-  Training: How Easy new users can be able to use the system
	- Use widgets which are familiar to user and appropriate to the task
