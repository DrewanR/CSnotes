## WHY??
Reveal new insights
Understanding experience or situations
Generating idea and hypotheses

## Open ended questions

| Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unlimited number of answers                   | Respondents give answers with different level of details |
| Respondents can qualify and clarify responses | Answers can be irrelevant                                |
| Can find the unanticipated                    | Forgetful or inarticulate responses                      |
|                                               | Coding responses is subjective and tedious               |
|                                               | More time and effort                                                         |

# Interviews
vague questions often result in vague answers
To get specific information: ask for information to illustrate critical aspects of the situation

**Goal of interviews:** *Capture elements of the experience and attitudes towards the research question*.

**When planning, you need:**
-  Carefully designed interview questions
-  A carefully chosen sample
-  A rigorous approach to analysis

Do **not** just ask the research question. Design questions to address it

Social encounters result in natural discussion
-  Short to the point, using familiar language
-  Not leading, open, as unbiased as possible
-  Open-ended
-  Open to description, detail and tangents
-  Grounded in real examples

### Structure
-  Start simply
-  Build a structure to cover the main points (control the direction, support flexibility)
-  Support narrative flow (Grouping related questions, using prompts to follow up on each one)
-  Close with gratitude (thanks) and an opportunity to follow up

# GET INFORMED CONSENT

# Effics
*(boo!)*
Potential pitfalls:
	The subject matter (controversial, sensitive, embarrassing, upsetting)
	Matters around researchers (conflict of interest)
Nature of Participants
	Children under 18
	Vulnerable people, old, physically or mentally ill
	Participants do not understand English

# Analysing Results
[[Week 9-Qualitative User Studies.pdf#page=22&selection=0,20,0,20|Week 9-Qualitative User Studies, page 22]] three pages here

1. Write each of your insights on a separate post-it note
2. Spread the notes on the table/desk so they are visible to everyone
3. Gather the team around the cards/post-it notes
4. Together look for ideas that are related and place them side by side
5. It is okay to have loners that do not fit any group
6. If a card/post-it note seems to belong in two groups, make a second one with the same finding and put it in both groups
7. When all cards/post-it notes are grouped select a title, a short description for each group and a representative finding
# Observations
Finding out what is happening
-  Physical, social, cultural, and economic context
-  Relationships among and between people, context, ideas, norms, events, etc.
-  People’s behaviours and activities

## WHY??
> Quantitative & lab studies fall short of understanding people in their “messy” everyday settings.
> People cannot always articulate the intricacies of their behaviour and interactions – “invisible”.
> If we don’t understand contextualised behaviours properly our designs could fail.

| Advantages                                                               | Disadvantages                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allows for insights into context, relationships behaviour                | Time consuming                                                                      |
| Can provide information previously unknown that may end up being crucial | Documentation relies on memory, discipline, diligence and the eye of the researcher |
|                                                                          | Requires conscious effort for objectivity                                                                                    |

# Tricks for observing and interviewing

> **Critical Incident Technique**
> • Particular incident (frustrating, surprising, annoying)
> • Description of the incident with details
> • Look for real examples of a breakdown

> **Recalling/Observing a specific Time**
> • Describe events of a specific time and day
> • How this typical day look like?
> • Look for interesting examples including breakdowns

> Life cycle of a particular activity/object
> • Find out the life history of something

> Qualitative Analysis (e.g., Affinity Diagram or also Thematic Analysis)
> • Themes from the analysis
> • Write an Interpretation
> • At least one representative example e.g., quotes or snippet
