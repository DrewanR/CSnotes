Helps validate assumptions and requirements
Discover problems early
Brainstorm ideas
Conduct early testing

> Sketches and prototypes are instantiations of a design concept but sketches are not prototypes entirely
> Sketches are used in the early ideation stages, whereas prototypes are more concentrated in later stages
> They differ in terms of cost, timeliness, quantity, and disposability

Start of with low-fidelity protocols and sketches as they are quicker.

> ***Low-fidelity*** prototypes are often paper-based and do not allow user interactions (from hand-drawn mock-ups to printouts -> very quick).
> ***High-fidelity prototypes*** are computer-based, and usually involves more realistic user interactions (as close as possible to a representation of the user interface)

`LM ` Wireframes
` MH` Working or simulation

> Formative Evaluation applying quantitative or qualitative methods
> • Get user feedback on the designs and requirements (sketches or prototypes)
> • Use scenarios to communicate and guide the users and validate user interactions
> • Provide suggestions for re-design

## Storyboards
Communicating via stories is how the human brain naturally works.
Stories convey meaning, meaning is understanding
Stories assist in remember facts.
