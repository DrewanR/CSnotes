This assessment consists of two parts:
1.  to create a static website (using HTML and CSS) on an aspect of the history of computing and the Internet
2.  to create a dynamic website (using HTML, CSS and CGI) to compute Easter dates 
Although both parts have the same formal deadline (Friday 8th December) we strongly encourage you to submit part 1 before Friday 1st December. In that way, we will be able to mark and provide feedback on part 1 during the lab sessions of Friday 1st December. This feedback can be useful when working on part 2.

Create a static website (using HTML and CSS) on an aspect of the history of computing and the Internet Using only HTML and CSS, create a website consisting of at least three web pages dedicated to either a person or a technology central to the development of computers or the Internet.
If the website is about a particular person, then it should contain separate pages about:
1. Information about the person (e.g. his or her personal background).
2. A discussion about the technological contribution he or she has made.
3. A discussion on why this technological contribution is still relevant today.
If the website is about a technology, then it should contain separate pages about:
1. The functionality it provides: what does it do and what is it for?
2. Some of the relevant technical details.
3. An overview of its history

- Include a table (with at least 2 columns and 3 rows) to provide a historical overview (e.g. year of birth, education, main achievements, and death if your website is about a person; years of main developments if your website is about a technology).
-  Also include a picture, such that clicking on it brings the user to a related external page (for example to a Wikipedia page). All pages of the website must be subject to CSS styling that is controlled by an external style sheet.
-  The website should be written entirely by hand using only HTML and CSS (that is, you are not allowed to use any kind of HTML/CSS code generators).
