Module map for autumn semester week 11
--------------------------------------

In week 11 (December 11-15) we give a broad overview of search engines, 
in particular of PageRank. Apart from that, there is also a revision
lecture about the online test in January, there is a mock online test
and there is an optional lecture about how to run a webserver using home
broadband and a raspberry pi.

For this week, the following activities are scheduled:
- [optional] Attend the lecture on Monday December 11 on how to run a
  webserver using home broadband and a raspberry pi. This topic will
  not be part of any assessment. The lecture will be delivered by
  Martin Caminada, who has recently returned from paternity leave.
- Do the mock online test, which is scheduled for Tuesday December 12 during
  the online lab session. This will give you some experience of how these
  online tests work, which will be useful when doing the real online test
  in January.
- Attend the lecture on Wednesday December 13 on search engines
  (which will be one of the topics of the online test in January).
- Attend the revision lecture on Thursday December 14, at which you will be 
  given an overview of which topics are and are not part of the 
  January online test, be given the opportunity to ask questions.
- [only if you have EC for the coursework] Attend the marking session on 
  Friday 15th December for those students who have been granted extension
  of the coursework deadline due to a successful Extenuating Circumstances 
  application.
