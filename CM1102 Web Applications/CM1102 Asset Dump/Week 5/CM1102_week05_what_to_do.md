Module map for autumn semester week 5
-------------------------------------

In week 5 (October 31 - November 4) we give an overview of :
- the history of the Web, and
- the structure of text files and character encodings

We also provide an overview of the module, how it is taught, 
where to find everything, and how the assessment will take place.

For this week, the following activities are scheduled:
- Attend the lectures on Monday October 30 (Introduction and History of
  the Web) and Thursday November 2 (HTML).
- Read chapters 1-5 of the book Beginning HTML and CSS.
- Finish the unassessed exercises of week 5. These come in two parts:
	* The first series of exercises (CM1102_exercise_week05a.pdf) will 
	  familiarise you with how to use some of the special features of 
	  your text editor, how to run the W3 Validator, and how to upload 
	  web pages to the university server. Bad things will happen if you
	  do not know how to do this by the time of the coursework deadline.
	* The second series of exercises (CM1102_exercise_week05b.pdf) will 
	  familiarize you with the various functionality provided by HTML.
	  This will be helpful for the coursework that will be handed out
	  next week.

All files are available on Learning Central under Autumn Week 5, except
for the book Beginning HTML and CSS, which is available under Reading Lists.

There will be online support sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.
