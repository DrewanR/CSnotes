Module map for autumn semester week 6
-------------------------------------

In week 6 (November 6-10) we give an overview of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
which is used to specify the layout of Web pages.

For this week, the following activities are scheduled:
- Attend the lectures on Mnday November 6th and Wednesday November 8th.
- Read chapters 7 and 8 of the book Beginning HTML and CSS 
  (reading Chapter 9 is optional)
- If necessary, have a look at www.w3schools.com
  This is where you can find some examples on how to implement 
  particular effects using HTML and CSS.
- Start working on (part 1 of) the coursework.

All files are available on Learning Central under Autumn Week 6, except
for the book Beginning HTML and CSS, which is available under Reading Lists.

There will be online support sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.
