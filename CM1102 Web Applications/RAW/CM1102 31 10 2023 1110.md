#CM1102 #raw  #ToNeaten 
## Two Assessments this semester
Coursework (40%), consisting of two parts
-  creating a small static website using HTML and CSS only
-  creating a small dynamic website using HTML, CSS and a Python CGI script
Plus 30 minute test (10%)

Other 50% is done by another lecturer next semester

# How the internet came about
`1969` The arpanet
*Created by academics and researchers to make communicating across long distance. This was when computers were massive. Before the only way to send information was to send stuff via mail between the centres.*

*Used phone lines*
![[CM1102_week05_2_background.pdf#page=4|CM1102_week05_2_background, page 4]]
``
`1983` TCP/IP
*Mostly used for emails so was very basic*

`1990s` FTP
*File upload and download*
`1990s` USENET
*Discussion groups were also formed*
`1990s` Gopher
*A texted based information system*
### The internet in the early 1990s
- Mainly text based
- Non-profit
- For the happy few

`1999` World Wide Web
*Created by Tim Berners Lee. Created for easier communication at CERN. Hypertext, which allowed for the creation of web pages*
## Foundations of the internet
[[Packet Switching]]
[[TCP-IP]]
[[Telnet]]
[[FTP]]
[[SMTP]]
[[Hypertext]]
## Building Blocks of the Web
[[HTML]]/[[CSS]]
[[HTTP]]
[[Web Server]]
[[Browser]]

### HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title> Hello There </title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello There</h1>
	<p> Welcome to the <a href="http://www.w3.org"> Web</a>.
	Some protocols:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> HTTP </li>
		<li> FTP </li>
		<li> SMTP </li>
	</ul> 
</body>
</html>
```
### HTTP
***HyperText Transfer Protocol***
A protocol that governs how the browser communicates with the server
### Web Server
![[CM1102_week05_2_background.pdf#page=25|CM1102_week05_2_background, page 25]]
### Browsers and layout engines
We will be using google chrome for testing stuff, on windows.

Netscape is a really old browser
## Current Standards
**[[HTLM 5]]** for specifying the *structure* of a page
[[CSS]] for specifying the *layout* of a page

# Web Text File Format
## Plain Text File Format
Each letter has a code.
Example below using [[ASCII]]
![[Pasted image 20231031115939.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231031120056.png]]
## New line conventions
Unix and linux: `LF`
Dos and Windows: `CR+LF`
Apple Mac (up to OS-9): `CR`

#ToDo 8-Bit from next slide
#ToDo ISO 8859
## Roundup ISO 8859
| Advantages                                                               | Disadvantages                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Does not require any additional space (ascii doesn't use the 8th bit) | 1. what if the same page needs several languages?                                      |
| 2. Relatively simple (once you know the code page)                       | 2. what about languages with more than 128 special characters (Chinese, Japanese, ...) |

## Unicode
Assigns every character a unique number *code point*
`Note:` Numbers 0-255 correspond with ISO 8859-1 character set (which includes ASCII)
Unicode by itself doesn't say anything about how things are encoded at byte level!

UCS-2: just use 2 bytes for each code point (instead of 1 just for ASCII/ISO-8859) Disadvantages:
-  it's not backward compatible with ASCII
-  Unicode now has more than 65t code points
-  it's generally considered obsolete (don't use it!)

UTF-8: use 1 byte if it's an ASCII character and multiple bytes if it's not (using a clever way of encoding that also specifies the length of multiple byte characters)
Advantages:
-  it's backward compatible with ASCII
-  can handle all Unicode code points
-  it's becoming the standard on the Web
![[CM1102_week05_3_textfiles.pdf#page=19&selection=0,23,0,23|CM1102_week05_3_textfiles, page 19]]

## Takeaway
Unicode with UTF-8 is usually the safe option (recommended as default encoding by W3C)

If you're writing your pages in just a single European language, using an ISO 8859 encoding will give you a small efficiency gain (each character is just 1 byte)

If you're planning to use just ASCII characters, it doesn't matter whether you're using ISO 8859 or UTF-8 because it's all the same!

Make sure your editor saves your file in the right format!
# How To Recognise Character Encoding
1) Guessing, based on a statistical analysis of the file contents (not recommended)
2) “Byte Order Mark” at the beginning of the file (like EF BB BF for UTF-8) (not recommended)
3) In the HTTP header: Content-Type:
	`text/html; charset=utf-8`
	(or us-ascii, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2, etc.)
	*You'd need to configure your web server to do this.*
4) In the HTML file itself:
	`<meta charset=”utf-8”>`
	(or us-ascii, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2, etc.)
# What plain text does not encode
- Any particular font
- Any particular particular font size
- Any special formatting
- Any particular colouring scheme

**HTML Requires plain text**
it makes use of markup to indicate special formatting:

```html
HTML uses markup tags to indicate structure or special formatting. <i>This text is displayed in italics</i> whereas <b>this text is displayed bold.</b>
```
HTML uses markup tags to indicate structure or special formatting. <i>This text is displayed in italics</i> whereas <b>this text is displayed bold.</b>

```html
HTML uses markup tags to indicate structure or special formatting. <em>This text is to be emphasized</em> whereas <strong>this text is to be strongly emphasized.</strong>
```
HTML uses markup tags to indicate structure or special formatting. <em>This text is to be emphasized</em> whereas <strong>this text is to be strongly emphasized.</strong>

## Key concepts of HTML
### Tags:
`<html>, </html>, <title>, </title>, <br>, …`
### Attributes/values
`<meta charset=”utf-8”>`
### Elements
`<title>An Example Page</title>`
### Nested Elements
`<body><p>Hello World!</p></body>`
### Empty Elements
`<br/> <meta charset=”utf-8”/>`
