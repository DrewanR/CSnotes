# UNIX philosophy
### Programs should:
> Do one thing
> Do it well
> Work together
> Process text streams
#### Worse is better
> Make it work, not perfect - perfection is usually ill-defined
> Let the user fix it, even if it's complex - they are not dumb
> Share the code freely (not fake openly) - at least it can be fixed
#### UIs
> Shells have a steep learning curve - at least there is one
> Using and programming are equivalent - greed says otherwise
> GUIs can deceive (\*), depend on culture ( ), and mostly fail:
> 	 - limited interoperability, automation, concurrency, accuracy/precision, choice
#### Over-engineering/abstraction/design
> Only creates limits
> Failure of OOP
#### Freedom
> Who controls/owns the box? â€” your (collective) choice
