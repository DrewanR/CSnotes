# Principles of UX design
[[#User-centricity]] [[#Consistent]] [[#Hierarchy]] [[#Context]] [[#User Control]] [[#Accessibility]] [[#Usability]]
### User-centricity
putting the user’s needs first and making decisions based on what you know about them and what they want from the product.
### Consistent
There are several layers to consistency in UX design. On the one hand, you want to keep your designs consistent in terms of how they look and function across all pages/screens and products within the same brand or product family.

At the same time, consistency also extends to meeting the user’s expectations for the kind of product you’re designing. For example, if you’re designing a flight booking app, your users will come in with certain expectations of how the app should function based on their experience with similar apps on the market. You don’t need to copy your competitors, but equally, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel.
### Hierarchy
Hierarchy relates to information architecture as well as the visual hierarchy of individual pages and screens. As a rule, the more important elements are at the ‘top’ of the hierarchy (i.e. more prominent and easier for the user to find).

Information architecture refers to the sitemap; the overall structure and organisation of your website or app and how the user navigates from one page or screen to another.
### Context
You need to understand who your users are and the context in which they’ll use your product(s). Context considers the circumstances in which your product will be used and how certain factors might impact the user experience.
### User Control
helping users to correct or reverse errors without throwing the entire user experience into disarray. User control and freedom can be built into the website by incorporating “Undo” and “Redo” functionality, providing “Cancel” buttons and clearly labelling alternative actions and routes the user can take if they want to revert a particular action.
### Accessibility
Ensuring the product or service is accessible to and usable for as many people as possible. It includes catering to the needs of people with disabilities, as well as understanding how different environments or situational factors might impact the user experience.

One example of designing for accessibility could be to use high colour contrast to ensure that text is legible for users with visual impairments. For real-world examples of accessible design in action, check out these websites which have nailed the accessible design principle.
### Usability
measure of how easy a product is to use. There are five components of usability to consider: Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors, and satisfaction.

# UX Roles

|  Analyze, develop, wireframe, protoype, test, iterate and refine a product to meet business goals and user needs            |  focuses on the usability of a website. Usability is whether the system is easy to learn and efficient to use. UI designers try to make systems more user friendly by improving site layout, organization or graphics.             |

### Sketches Wireframes Mock-ups
Sketches: rough sketch of the website, typically very quick
Wireframe: Low-fidelity diagram showing the layout of the buttons and elements
Mock-ups: Static medium-to-high fidelity images of the website
Prototype: Realistic representation of what the website will look like.

## Good: Google
> Simple
> Clean
## Good: Airbnb
> Simple
> Very visual
## Good: Spotify
> Looks good
> Gives recommendations
> Very user orientated

# Accessibility
> BENEFITS
> In addition to access to information, there is also a strong business case for accessibility. It overlaps with other best practices such as mobile Web design, usability, design for older users and optimized searches.
> Case studies have shown that accessible websites have:
> - Better search results
> - Reduced maintenance costs
> - And increased audience reach.

Accessibility is not:
- Text-only pages
- Separate accessible version (except for multimedia)
- Boring or difficult
Accessibility is:
- Building webpages that can be read and navigated by everyone regardless of ability, location, experience or technology

About **22%** of the Bri'ish population has some kind of disability
Major kinds include:
	Visual, Hearing, Motor, Cognitive.

### Barriers to accessibility
#ToDo 

### Basic Accessible Design Principles
1. Provide appropriate alternative text for images
2. Caption videos, provide transcripts for audio
3. Make file downloads, e.g. PDFs accessible
4. Do not rely on colour alone to convey meaning
5. Make sure content is structures, clearly written and easy to read

### Things you can do:
1. Keep navigation the same on each page
2. Have a way for the user to increase/decrease font on the pages
3. Have high enough contrast between background and text
4. Have alternate text for images and videos
5. MAKE LINKS MAKE SENSE
6. Forms and tables should be properly formatted

### Examples
Content
• Relevant content for the page
• Relevant page titles
• Heading markup
• Correct HTML markup for relevant content
For scripts, applets and plugins
• Have an alternative way to access the information
• Offer information in plain text format when possible; PDFs and Flash files are not easily accessible
• Do not use different coloured text to convey meaning

### Tricks for testing accessibilty
Does the website still work without the CSS
