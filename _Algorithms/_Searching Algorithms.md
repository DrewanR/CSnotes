> The built in function will always be quicker and better in every single way than what you could program, so stick to that :3.

Just use the built in python index function, or equivalent when programming
[[Linear Search]] O(n)
[[Binary Search]] O(log  n)

[[Interpolated Binary Search]]
## Comparisons
[[Binary search]] is scales better than binary search, surpassing [[linear search]] very quickly... *however* it requires [[_Sorting Algorithms|sorting]], which is far more intensive than searching, especially with longer lists. If you are planning on searching a list frequently you only need to sort it once, and keeping it sorted.
