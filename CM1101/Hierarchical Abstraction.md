# Abstraction
By dictionary: a general term or idea

***In computer science:***
> Separating Meaning from implementation

## Main Characteristics
Applying level by level, in layers.
Abstraction at some level will hide all implementation details at a lower level
Enable us to consider a task at different levels of detail

# Why
It enables us to consider a task or machine a level appropriate for our needs, hiding away irrelevant details or complexity. Not being impeded by unnecessary detail, often results in a better understanding of the purpose and operation of something at a level appropriate for the situation.

A given abstraction level is essentially independent of those below it.
