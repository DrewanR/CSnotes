# Languages
Languages exist and develop to aid, and to some extent allow for communication between parties.
### Natural Languages
Languages like English, French, Russian have naturally evolved to facilitate communication between humans.
### Artificial (Formal) Languages
Languages designed for specific applications, to help communicate specialist ideas, and to more easily reason about certain problems.
***EG:** Written music, Chemical formula, Electrical symbols, Algebra*
### What do they all have in common
**Elementary Building Blocks:** *The atoms of the language. The smallest bricks.*
**Syntax:** *Rules of composition.*
**Semantics:** *meaning.*

# Programming languages
We ***dont*** write in program languages for computers, they exist to be readable and easily to understand for humans.

**HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES** *provide greater abstraction and composition. Making things easier for humans, at the cost of being further from what the machine does and less control.*
**LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES** *Have less abstraction, making them harder for humans but typically allowing greater control and being closer to what the machine uses.*

**COMPILER**  *a program that translates an entire high-level language program into machine instructions, before runtime.*
**INTERPERITER** *Does it in real time at run time.*
### Python is a high level language that uses an interpreter.
# 2 Types of interpreter
**Read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) = interactive mode**
	*The interpreter executes Python commands as you enter them and immediately outputs the results (if any).*
	
**File mode = non-interactive mode = batch mode**
	*The interpreter executes an entire program stored in a file (or files).
	By convention, we add the extension .py to the names of files that store Python programs.
	A program can be stored in a file(s) and executed whenever you want to.*

File mode is typically used used.
