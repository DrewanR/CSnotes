# Introduction to Algorithms
Precursor to python module.
## Algorithm
A way of writing down and communicating a solution to a problem.
Not just what we do, but how how we do it.
**REMINDER** *Humans are stupid, they will not act rationally*
# Definitions
A **algorithm** *is a procedure for solving aa problem that specifies actions to be executed and the order in which they shall be executed*

**Pseudocode** *is an informal language similar to everyday English used to describe algorithms*

**Greedy algorithm** *Takes the most optimal next step without thinking about the overall picture. E.G Primm's algorithm that just picks the lowest with a connection to the tree*
## Concerns with algorithms
Does it do its job?
Does it do its job efficiently?
Does it halt?
What is a valid input?
