# Computational thinking
*(quoted from [[00_computational_thinking.pdf]], using sqrt as example)*
However, all this knowledge does not help to actually find square roots!
What we need is some kind of recipe, procedure, method, algorithm for finding square roots.
There are two types of knowledge, two ways of thinking:
### “What is” knowledge
-  Statements of facts. What is true about things.
-  We call it ***declarative knowledge.***
### “How to” knowledge
-  How to do things.
-  Recipes, procedures, instructions, methods, algorithms.
-  We call it ***algorithmic knowledge.***

 Create a page for declarative knowledge vs algorithmic

-->"Babylonian method” for sqrts
```
procedure SQUAREROOT(x)
Choose desired accuracy, e.g. A ← 0.0
Make an initial guess g ← x
while the error |g2 − x| > A repeat the following:
	replace g with an improved guess: g ← (g+x/g)/ 2
Finally, g is the result, i.e. g ≈ √x
end procedure
```
Works best for non integers.
Makes a guess then, if not within an appropriate error, it will do and makes an improved guess until it is within the desired accuracy

If the initial guess is zero, you end up dividing by zero... which is illegal.
## The point
When working with computers, they cant operate on declarative knowledge. Instead they have to use algorithmic knowledge.

Further questions can be asked:
	Does this method work correctly?<br>Does it always work? For all numbers? If not, when does it not work?<br>How fast does it work? How many repetitions do we need to make to reach the desired accuracy?<br>Are there faster methods to find square roots?<br>Will this method always stop?<br>How much of other resources (e.g. memory) are needed?<br>Can this method be used to solve other problems apart from square roots?

# Languages
Languages exist and develop to aid, and to some extent allow for communication between parties.
### Natural Languages
Languages like English, French, Russian have naturally evolved to facilitate communication between humans.
### Artificial (Formal) Languages
Languages designed for specific applications, to help communicate specialist ideas, and to more easily reason about certain problems.
***EG:** Written music, Chemical formula, Electrical symbols, Algebra*
### What do they all have in common
**Elementry Building Blocks:** *The atoms of the language. The smallest bricks.*
**Syntax:** *Rules of composition.*
**Semantics:** *meaning.*

 Annotate this "what rules are being violated here": ![[Pasted image 20231005120954.png]]
# Programming languages
We ***dont*** write in program languages for computers, they exist to be readable and easily to understand for humans.

**HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES** *provide greater abstraction and composition. Making things easier for humans, at the cost of being further from what the machine does and less control.*
**LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES** *Have less abstraction, making them harder for humans but typically allowing greater control and being closer to what the machine uses.*

**COMPILER**  *a program that translates an entire high-level language program into machine instructions, before runtime.*
**INTERPERITER** *Does it in real time at run time.*
### Python is a high level language that uses an interpreter.
