# History of computers

## Early Computers
Earlier computers were often people or mechanicals
# flesh out
### 1613
Word computer originates as a job role, where people did calculations. Their work is scarily undocumented. These "computers" were often woman and names weren't recorded.
### Abacus
First devise used for calculations about x BC 
### Pascaline
Used levers and dials to do calculation
figure out what operations they can perform
### Stepped Reckoner
Origin of the word calculator
Addition subtraction, **multiplication and division**
### Difference engine
Considered first computer
Can evaluate polynomials
### Analytical engine
1837
Considered the first fully programmable computer.
### ENIAC
1943-1946
Unreliable, Expensive, Large, Power intensive. 

Second generation arrived 1950s smaller, cheaper, faster

Used punch cards for inputs and outputs

Third gen introduced integrated circuits

4th gen introduced the microprocessor (present)

Fifth generation is AI (present to future)

# Hierarchical Abstraction
## Abstraction
~~a general term or idea~~
**Separating meaning from implementation.**
### main characteristics
Applies level by level
hides details of lower levels

High level languages are a form of abstraction, hiding the implementation of low level concepts
Functions are also another example of abstraction.

A lower level is assembly, which is above machine code.

 make into pretty diagram: adding example
## WHY
Enables us to consider a task or machine at a level appropriate for our needs, removing the need to consider only the relevant details

Application level and so on
### why both instruction levels:
Machine code is completely unreadable to humans. Assembly is somewhat readable to humans.

## Program VS integrated circuitry
Hardware and software are equivalent, they are just two different ...

# Von Neumann Architecture
Most computers use this architecture
Early computers weren't that reprogrammable. To change function the computer must be rebuilt or rewired.
1945, Von Neumann proposed a more flexible architecture where this rewiring would not need to occur.

The program is treated in the same way as the data. In practice this means that both instructions and data are stored within memory

Five components:
## Memory unit
Memory is a collection of cells, with a unique adress.
Memory's adressibity ...

Instructions operate a word a time. Data is fetched one word at a time.
## Input unit
Allows data and program to be entered into the computer
Early on it was punch cards
## Output unit

## Arithmetic-Logic Unit
Capable of performing basic operations +-X/
Modern ALUs have registers which store a little bit of data to speed things up
## Control Unit
Contains the [[Current Instruction register]] and
Contols the operation
Coordinated the fetch execute decode cycle
## CPU
CU and ALU are combined to for a CPU
# Fetch Execute Decode Cycle
Rewrite this trauma
## System Bus Model
is a streamlined Von Neumann Model
# The Von Neumann Bottleneck
All the data **must** go through the same bus resulting in a bottleneck

This is becoming more of a problem over time, as CPU speed and memory speed has increased at a far more rapid rate than the bus can carry.

Attempts to get around it

Also GPUs
Signals are limited by the speed of light. This means we are trying to make stuff smaller, however we are starting to reach the limit of the atoms themselves
# GPUs VS CPUs
GPUs are growing 
### Moore's Law
The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years

# Data Representation
--> [[Data Representation]]
## Radix Number Systems

| English     | Base | Digits           | Use |
| ----------- |:----:| ---------------- | --- |
| Decimal     |  10  | 0123456789       | Humans    |
| Binary      |  2   | 01               | What computers use    |
| Octal       |  8   | 01234567         |     |
| Hexadecimal |  16  | 0123456789ABCDEF | Easily converts to binary as 4 binary digits equals one hex one    |

Subscript is used to denote which base is currently being used. If no subscript is present, we often assume that when the subscript is not present it is in decimal form. Only new/weaker areas have been detailed below.
## Decimal to Binary Conversion
For the digits to the left of the decimal point, use the reminder method. (refer to [[4 - Data representation.pdf|pdf]], its the method I already use). For digits after the decimal point, use the multiplication method:

NOTE: the numbers in the square brackets are getting multiplied.

Rounding will often need to occur.
Practice [[Drawing 2023-10-03 13.38.12.excalidraw|here]].
## Why is binary used with computers
Ones and zeros are used, as they are represented by either a high or low voltage. This means that variance in voltages doesn't break everything.

## Converting Between Decimal and Octal 
The reminder method can be used here, where you divide by 8 instead, the reminder is the bit. The multiplication method presumably works the same way.
## Range and Precision
### Fixed point
| Range     | Minimum number to maximum                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Precision | Minimum difference between two adjacent nums |
There is a tradeoff to having a greater range or greater precision
## Negative Numbers & Two's compliment
To represent negative numbers one has to sacrifice one bit. Sign and magnitude can be used, however this results in a +0 and -0. The main method is two's compliment.

This is where the the lowest bit, say there is 8 bits, the 2^7 digit becomes -2^7.

You can subtract numbers by adding a negative number. `x - y = x + -y`
If the number is negative:
1) Carry out a standard binary conversion of the magnitude;
2) Fill up the spaces with zeros;
3) Invert all the bits (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0)
4) Finally, add 1
Example: to store the integer -12 in 8 bit register
1) 12 → 1100
2) 1100 → 00001100
3) 00001100 → 11110011
4) 11110011 + 1 = 11110100
