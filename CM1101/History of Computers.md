## The Word Computer
*Dates back to 1613*
A job title for a human who did calculations. These computers are remarkably undocumented.
Entering the 20th century it was redefined as being a device that aids humans in performing various calculations or computation tasks.

# Early Computers
## Abacus
*2700-2300 BC*
An ancient devise used for calculations, distant ancestor of modern computers. Acted more as an aid for tracking numbers than doing the calculations itself.

```
Capable of: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION
```
## *- Mechanical Era -*
## Pascaline
*1642, Blaise Pascal*
Also known as the arithmetic machine. The first mechanical calculator. Used gears and levers to increase the automation of calculation.

Higher wheel rotates by 1 when a lower dial produces a carry
-  Can do addition directly on machine
-  Can do subtraction by method of complements
-  Short multiplication/division by repeated addition/subtraction
-  Example: 28 + 35 = 63

```
Capable of: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION*, DIVISION*
	*Through workarounds
```
## Stepped Reckoner
*1671, Gottfried Wilhem von Leibniz*
Also known as the Leibniz calculator.

> *"It is beneath the dignity of excellent men to waste their time in calculation when any peasant could do the work just as accurately with the aid of a machine."*

“Leibniz wheel” allows for long multiplication and division.

```
Capable of: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION
```
## The Difference Engine
*1822, Charles Babbage*
**Considered first first computer.** Can evaluate polynomials, means approximate trigonometric functions and logarithms.

```
Capable of: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION,
			POLYNOMIALS, BASIC TRIGONOMETRY, LOGARITHMS
```
## The Analytical Engine
*1837, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace*
Considered the first programmable computer. Early version of modem components:
-  **Mill** *Performs arithmetic operations*
-  **Operator** *processes operations specified by punch cards*
-  **Store** *holds data on punch cards*
-  **Output** *prints results*

## ***E***lectronic ***N***umerical ***I***ntegrator ***A***nd ***C***alculator
*1943-1946*
Arguably the first large-scale, general purpose, electronic digital computer.
Breath-taking speed: 300 multiplications or 5000 additions per second.
Enormous size: 17,500 vacuum tubes, 500,000 soldered connections, filled a 50-foot long basement room, weighed 30 tons.

# Generations of Computers
## 1st Generation
*1940 - 1956, [[Vacuum Tubes]]*
Large, Expensive, Huge amount of electricity.
e.g. [[History of Computers#***E***lectronic ***N***umerical ***I***ntegrator ***A***nd ***C***alculator|ENIAC]]
## 2nd Generation
*1956 - 1963, [[Transiters]]*
Smaller, Cheaper, Faster.

Both 1st and 2nd used: *punch cards for inputs, print outs for outputs* both needing to be decoded
## 3rd Generation
*1964 - 1971, [[Integrated Circuits]]*
Faster, Cheaper, Smaller, Less electricity, Fewer mistakes, Keyboards, Monitors
## 4th Generation
*1967 - Present, [[Microprocessor]]*
Faster, Cheaper, Smaller, Less electricity, Less heat.
More ways to interact.
## 5th Generation\*
*Present - Future, [[AI]]*
Bridge the gap between computing and thinking.
